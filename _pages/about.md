Hi, my name is Denilson Nastacio, and I work in tech for big co (IBM.) You can find my professional information on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nastacio/), but here are some highlights.

I started in 1997, and I had fantastic opportunities to work on fun things, such as locating hardware in a data center using air temperature (ask me about it) and training an Artificial Intelligence to find treatments for cancer patients (ask me about it too!)

For a few years, I was tasked with designing the operations engineering practice for a global service hosting over 100K applications. Eventually, I switched projects, and started writing more often.

## My writing

My writing is a mixture of seemingly distinct topics: technical deep dives like ["The art and science of probing a Kubernetes container"](https://sourcepatch.blogspot.com/2022/01/kubernetes-probes-part-3-promql.html) and examining the influences of philosophy and psychology in software development in posts like ["What is the hardest thing in software development?"](naming-reality) and ["Rewriting the most critical system in the world."](rewriting-education)

You can follow me on [Medium.com](https://dnastacio.medium.com) or read my archive of stories [here](blogs.html).

## My drawing

People often ask me about the illustrations in my stories, and yes, they are personally drawn with pen or pencil (I also make my best effort to create "alt text" descriptions for each of them.)
