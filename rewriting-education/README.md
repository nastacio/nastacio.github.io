# Rewriting the largest system in the world

*First, you must learn what you have learned.*

This story is a sequel to "What is the hardest thing in software development?"

If you have not read that story, I unceremoniously spoil it here: The most challenging activity in software development is creating abstract worlds and convincing others that these worlds are real.

Learn, create, educate. That is the job.

<< work for other professions, I surely don't understand all of them >>

A successful system has parts that work together and interconnect into efficient workflows. And participants are parts too. As you read through this story, consider your expanded "student" role as follows:
A new member of a team that has been together for a while
A current team member is learning about additions to the system made by a colleague.
A user of a new feature in a system (accurate word or virtual.)
Conversely, consider the opposite side of the "student" role if you were in the opposite situation:
Experienced team member tasked with onboarding a new colleague.
System designer or developer explaining additions to the system to a colleague.
System designer or developer explaining additions to the system to a user of the system.

We must first understand the system before we can contribute.

Knowledge precedes creation. 
Deconstructing the old system

Before we can create and educate, we must first learn.

And every time we pick up the book or attempt to learn, we face the same hidden obstacle. It starts with one of the world's most well-established and formalized systems: the school.

Society marshaled most of us through a traditional school system. And what a system. A mass-production pipeline spanning 10 to 14 years of education, depending on the country where you live. A structured environment bringing teachers and students into classrooms on a fixed calendar schedule. A complex combination of parts, participants, and workflows.

It taught us to read, remember, and reason.

Learning we did and learning we can, so why spend time discussing a system we have long left? How does it help me create software?

Because the educational system is a system within a larger (societal) system. It shapes our formative years with methods and rules. To function in that system, we must become the system.

We take it with us to adulthood, into our social and professional lives, with habits and traits, good or bad. It is ever-present - for those around us - and, simultaneously, unconscious - school is what it was.

To paraphrase the great philosopher D. Rumsfeld, we went to school with the system we had, not the system we wanted or wished to have later."

Remember what I wrote earlier? "Learn, create, and educate."

We are now equipped to understand and deconstruct our learning experience and reason about what it was and what it can be, lest we propagate knowledge in the same ways we were taught.

And I am not saying everyone's experience was not good. Maybe your experience was great, but even good experiences deserve examination to isolate what was good about them. But ultimately, that was a mass-production system incompatible with the way we learn and educate in software development. Even the best of experiences with the school system will not offset a lot of indoctrination.

Just like the educational system is a system within a system, educating others about our new virtual worlds of knowledge will be its own educational system. Another system within a system. We can make it a much better one, though. 

To recall the introduction one more time, we must understand the system before we can contribute. If we want to make progress, we must first go back.

As a generation - make it multiple generations when you consider the age spread in the profession today - how did we go through school? How were we taught to learn and interact with the world?

A factory of knowledge for the factories
Historians and educators trace the origins of the modern public school system to the  Prussian education system, established in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

While schools and compulsory education may have predated the Prussian approach at the time, nothing comes even close in terms of mass adoption and influence across the world. From West to East, whenever a child sits in a classroom, you can see the influences.

An influence is not an essence, but as a system within a system, it evolves slowly, with pushes and pulls across generational boundaries. Today's students are tomorrow's teachers, and by "tomorrow," I mean two decades later. To reach the workforce, double the timetable for that pipeline to roll forward towards progress.

And what is in the pipeline?

The education system is based on learning theories. Psychologists, neuroscientists, and educators keep evolving their understanding of cognition, making their contributions to learning theory and, by extension, to the education system.



Learning theories
If we are going to be prepared to learn - so we can create new worlds - and educate - so we can bring users into these worlds - we must understand how people learn.

We must also understand how we learned. The mind is a beautiful thing, and the brain is a competent computer. On a good day, they can give you heuristics that are essential to facilitate problem-solving and judgment. On a worse day, they give you cognitive biases that can make you seem irrational and unfair.

What separates those days is such a thin line that it may be really difficult to see it until we look at the same reality from different angles. Perspective.

We went through a system heavily based on "behaviorist" and "cognitive psychology" learning theories. These are the two most prominent learning theories, with "constructivism" rounding out a de-facto triad - There are other less prevalent learning theories as well. You may skim this list and chime in the comments section if you spot your school using something outside these three.

Behaviorism
Behaviorists are interested in measurable changes in behavior.

Ace a spelling contest and receive a treat from the teacher. Stimuli and behavior. Promote the desired behavior, and suppress the unwanted ones.

Conditioning.

Behaviorism deals in terms like classical conditioning and its better sibling, operant conditioning.

Classical conditioning is about unconsciously pairing specific actions or stimuli with a behavioral response. If it sounds awful as an educational tool, that is because it is.

Operant conditioning employs positive and negative reinforcements to encourage or discourage behaviors. Ask different generations about the benefits (or necessity of) negative reinforcement, and you get different opinions. 

That does not make older generations necessarily meaner, but they spent over a decade of their childhood being taught to accept that rules, fair or abusive, were to be followed. Rewards and punishment. 

You can fight monsters without becoming one, but it is a lifelong battle in a front between flexibility and order, constantly worrying that one may overtake the other. One must fight monsters with care.

Positive reinforcement is the only salvageable branch of behaviorist theory. There are great examples, such as praise, a high five, and telling someone that you are happy for (or fond of) their accomplishments. 

And I conclude with an acknowledgment of its corporate offshoot: gamification. There are good and not-so-good implementations. The overarching theme for successful ones is a system that benefits the employee or things the employee cares about. On the flip side, naked PLB strategies (Points and Leader Boards) generate a rush of initial enthusiasm and eventually fail to sustain engagement. Net: Save the Dopamine rush strategies for online games.

Cognitive psychology
You would think that educators and psychologists would have had enough of behaviorism, and they did.

Cognitive psychology started to make inroads into learning circles around the late 1950s. A generation of school teachers influenced by those theories would take a whole generation to reach classrooms. 

Educators at the time had enough of behaviorism and their shunning of mental processes while designing instructional methods. In a way, behaviorists were the first to experiment with machine learning algorithms, but using human brains.

With cognitive psychology, educators start talking about subjects such as perception, language, metacognition, and knowledge organization.

People begin to consider neuroscience to weigh on instruction design, correlating cognitive function with their physical location in the brain. Common knowledge ("taking a walk helps me think") becomes science ("people perform better on tests of memory and attention after brief physical activity.") 

We start to learn how we learn.

Here is a small list of examples:

Attention: The separation between sensory processing and deep processing. The mind can process an underlying message at a semantic level even as the input format changes. Imagine the possibilities for a virtual medium like software interfaces.

Declarative vs. Procedural Memory: Declarative memory is how we remember facts. Procedural memory is for skills. They engage different parts of the brain. In software development, one would be the table of contents on a product manual; the other would be a hands-on tutorial. 

Perception. How do we perceive the world? Which senses do we use? Are you a visual or a kinesthetic learner? If you are a visual learner, watch a YouTube video. If you are a reader-style learner, you may need your college professor to hand you a transcript before class. 

Language. Now we can talk about meaning, vocabulary acquisition, relational frame theory, and many others. Language is almost a cognition chapter in itself, with researchers dissecting and reassembling language into large language models (LLM) that have reached human-like characteristics.

Metacognition is knowledge about knowledge. Metacognition is an awareness of thought processes and how they work. For example, when you spot an 18-foot tall stick with a green mass on its top, it invokes the mental schema of a tree. Being aware that your brain is executing that process is metacognition.

As the creators of new worlds, for the first time, we had the tools to understand how others perceive and interact with those worlds. The first few decades of computing were, at the same time, exceptional years and years in a state of exception.

And because educational systems move in generational cycles, some of those years reached well into the 80s.

Those intervening decades were exceptional because while software engineering was creating new worlds, the hardware supporting it was a shade away from a miracle.

Those decades were years in a state of exception because those systems allowed tasks that had never been possible before. With manned missions landing on the Moon, humanity didn't stop to question the usability of its guidance systems. With little squares bouncing between virtual paddles on a TV set, we were obliged to see a tennis table.

With cognitive sciences, we could still fight monsters without becoming one.

But we learned something new: we could also win.

Constructivism
The cornerstone of constructivist theory is that students perceive their environment and use the information to build new knowledge atop knowledge they already have.

Around the same time the Prussian education method spread worldwide, Dr. Maria Montessori's work showed that children left to their own devices with limited guidance could outperform children in public school.

It is hard to convey the importance and ramifications of Dr. Montessori's work in the classroom and academia. Most of what you like in the modern classroom started with her, a giant in the education community worldwide, influencing Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development.

"From thought to structures, from structures to thought."

I heard this phrase in a classroom decades ago. I tried to search for the author multiple times without success, but it is a powerful lesson nonetheless, as it describes the iterative nature of the cognition process. 
 
We generate thoughts as we perceive the world. We process thoughts based on our immediate mental schemas. From thought to structures. 

Experience and interaction with the environment may not fit the mental schemas, so we form new ones to help us make sense of the information. From structures to thought.

Now, fast-forward past formal education, and consider a constructivist approach in a professional environment, where smaller teams set their schedules and trained programmers have access to every shred of knowledge in the world at their fingertips.

Here are the constructivist core concepts:

Our minds are in perpetual pursuit of cognitive equilibrium:
We assimilate the information from our environment according to our mental schemas. That is how we perceive the world.
We accommodate information if we find out we cannot assimilate it by modifying our mental schemas. That is how we learn.

Our minds eventually reach an equilibrium with the surroundings of our physical world. That equilibrium is an unstable one. As we learn more, we perceive more. As we perceive more, we learn more. And the cycle repeats.

That learning cycle is a little different for software development because we modify the "environment," too, creating new concepts in virtual worlds. Sometimes we make the virtual worlds themselves. 

We make sense of these worlds through tall stacks of abstractions —skyscrapers of incomprehensible complexity outside the communities building these skyscrapers.

With science and method, we no longer fight monsters.

We study them.

Eventual consistency

The system helps shape the child, but in the long run, human nature shapes the system. That is especially true of learning and education systems. They always lag.

Learning starts industrialized, but ...

With a changed environment and knowledge, society must seek a new point of cognitive equilibrium. As society assimilates information, it struggles to do so with the theories of the past, and new theories must be formed. 

Learning theories progressed considerably between the formation of the modern education system and the present day. 

We have a better and evolving understanding of the mind (psychology,) the brain (neuroscience,) and learning (learning sciences.) While it was beneficial to reexamine the past to understand our tendencies in learning and teaching, we must now turn to the present.

This leads us to the next section.
Going to production, from theory to practice
Once outside the school system, it is time to adapt learning theories to practices in a new system: the job market system.

We leave a structured approach of prepared curriculums delivered to us on a staggered schedule and join a world of ad-hoc onboarding and training processes.

Adults start favoring problem-centered, self-paced learning strategies with a focus on what is relevant and urgent to them. Society flexes its productive arm, and the industry and educators respond with new theories and methods focused on increased productivity. 

And a century later, here we are, back to a factory of knowledge for the factories, but with the illusion of choice. 

As a software developer in an active role in transforming information into knowledge and communicating that knowledge, it goes without saying that learning about educational theories and methods is part of the job.

While I could start stringing descriptions of theories such as Andragogy, Heutagogy, or Expectancy-Value Theory, or weave an argument about adopting aspects of Instructional Design in onboarding processes. I leave all of that for another day. I wanted to dedicate my final point of this story to the most important of all systems.

You.

<< picture >>

The brain and the mind form an incredible system. If the brain is the machine, the mind is a mixture of software and something else we still don't comprehend: consciousness.

While we must leave the inexplicable to future generations of scientists - add "life" to the list - we should still understand a little more about the part we can comprehend.

One could argue that we can go through life without that examination, just like we can use a smartphone - another incredible combination of software and hardware - without seeing, let alone understanding, what is happening behind the glass.

There are several problems with that argument, though. Before you can learn in earnest, and because science shows that we may struggle to keep multiple concepts simultaneously in our brains, I created a list of the top three most important things we need to understand about ourselves:

Schemas
If you have time for one thing after reading this story, watch "The Psychology of Schemas: Why Childhood Can Mess Us Up" by Dr. Tori Olds. It talks about the influence of parents, but you can extrapolate the effects to any adult figure in a position of influencing your childhood, like grade school teachers.

As constructivist animals, processing information differently according to our mental schemas, we did not have as many of them early in our lives. At the core of our present-day mind, we may still find the primordial schemas that processed our first rounds of information in childhood and the improved schemas that accommodated that information.

In many ways, our mental schemas are like cathedrals built over long periods, with different styles adopted across different ages. What we learned two decades ago influences how we will teach today, just like our teachers in the past taught with influences from how they learned in the past. We may be contemporary in action, but our instincts about what is efficient and correct are either lacking or outdated. In historical terms, still outstanding, but think of what is possible.

Understanding schemas helps you deal with the past.

Biases
If you have time to read a second thing after learning about schemas in the previous section, skim this list of cognitive biases.

Our brains and mind are extremely adaptable, and natural selection contributes too. Still, science tells us the brain's machinery is not evolving at the same pace as our access to information, which is a precursor to knowledge. 

Faced with new information, our brain reflexively resorts to approximating the information and situation to something it has seen before making a decision similar to the previous decision. This process allows us to solve problems by reusing previous knowledge, resulting in faster decisions. At some point in humanity's distant path, that was probably the difference between being lunch or eating dinner. In modern times, it may be the difference between working late or eating dinner at home. I mentioned this process earlier, and it is called "heuristics."

The modern challenge is that this process is adapted to a small amount of information. A tool for a simpler time. When confronted with large volumes of somewhat nuanced information, we get the less desirable effect of biases, where our brain misclassifies the information and generates the wrong knowledge. Add aspects of social isolation and the lack of signals indicating the wrong conclusion, and biased knowledge can last a long time.

Understanding biases helps you keep your involuntary brain processes in check. It takes care of the present.

Parting thoughts
As you set out to create new worlds, you are in a unique position as the source of knowledge about those worlds. You are often an educator of last resort because you are often the sole source of that knowledge.

This story showed two almost parallel paths. The path of what it should be trails the path of what is by several decades. The immediate way is a way of quick and consistent results, if not the best results. The second one is a path based on the science of how humans learn. I hope to have showed how that second path trails the first by generations and how educators operate at the edge of time rift between the latest science and what the system had in the classroom when they learned how to teach. 

Compared to education pioneers, we have access to virtually all knowledge in the world. In our work, we will also create all the knowledge supporting many worlds. Educating others about these worlds is what populates the land. And because no one wants to spend time building desolate realities, we must get past being educators of last resort and become good ones.

When you hear your technical elders talk about communication skills, listening, collaboration, adaptability, empathy, and patience, they are in fact urging you to develop the qualities of being a good teacher.

While we all have acquired learning and teaching skills along the way, history teaches us that the collective wisdom shaped by an industrialized society can make choices that favor industrialization rather than long-term value.

How much of seemingly intractable problems like "I don't like writing docs" or "The code is the documentation" or "The user just doesn't get it" come from simple lack of telling people in CS and SW courses that running code is simply one of many important activities in creating software. That code is at the same time a manifestation of knowledge and  a creation of knowledge in a long pipeline and that if the next cog in the pipeline cannot comprehend that knowledge than the whole pipeline might as well not exist?
